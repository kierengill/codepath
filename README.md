CodePath IOS App Course

I took this course because I was interested in IOS app development. I made three projects:
- FLIX: A movie app that allows users to browse movies from the The Movie Database API.
- Instagram: A basic working version of Instagram.
- Twitter: A basic working version of Twitter.
